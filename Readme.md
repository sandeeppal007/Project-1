## Learning 

1️⃣  CSS Position 
   
  ✨ With the help of position we can move the elememnt anywhere on the page

  ✨ Just use the property Position :    Relative and     Absolute.

  ✨ Other Properties are top,bottom, left and right.


2️⃣  Z-index

✨ Help to specifies the stack order of an 
  element

✨ Want to an element backward to the next element 

✨ Same as an project mesh grid back to image that is done by z-index;
